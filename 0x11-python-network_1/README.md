# 0x11. Python - Network #1
## Overview
This project focuses on network programming in Python, particularly utilizing libraries like urllib and requests for making HTTP requests and handling responses. It involves tasks such as fetching internet resources, decoding responses, handling HTTP errors, and interacting with APIs.

### Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

* Fetch internet resources using the Python package urllib.
* Decode urllib response bodies.
* Utilize the Python package requests for making HTTP requests.
* Make HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and other types of requests.
* Fetch JSON resources and manipulate data from external services.
### Resources
- urllib Package
- Quickstart with Requests package
- Requests package
### Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file at the root of the repository containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file at the root of the folder of this project is mandatory
- Code should adhere to PEP8 style guidelines (pycodestyle version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using wc
- All modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- Use get to access dictionary values by key
- Documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method
- Code should not be executed when imported (if __name__ == "__main__":)
## Tasks
This project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of network programming in Python. Some of the tasks include:

### Task 0: What's my status? - Write a Python script that fetches the status of a specified URL using urllib.
### Task 1: Response header value - Write a Python script that retrieves a specific header value from a given URL using urllib.
### Task 2: POST an email - Write a Python script that sends a POST request with an email parameter to a specified URL using urllib.
### Task 3: Error code - Write a Python script that handles HTTP errors and displays the appropriate error code using urllib.
### Task 4: What's my status? (using requests) - Write a Python script that fetches the status of a URL using the requests package.
### Task 5: Response header value (using requests) - Write a Python script that retrieves a specific header value from a URL using the requests package.
### Task 6: POST an email (using requests) - Write a Python script that sends a POST request with an email parameter to a URL using the requests package.
### Task 7: Error code (using requests) - Write a Python script that handles HTTP errors and displays the appropriate error code using the requests package.
### Task 8: Search API - Write a Python script that searches for a user based on a given letter using a POST request.
### Task 9: My GitHub! - Write a Python script that uses Basic Authentication with a personal access token to access GitHub API and display user information.
### Task 10: Time for an interview! - Write a Python script that retrieves and lists recent commits of a repository on GitHub using the GitHub API.
